## My process

Started with basic align and position, then started to build up main page style by just looking the original example and doing some research to improve code.

Once finished styling and all necessary changes, started to refactoring all code to improve code reading and logic used.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Bootstrap
-   GitHub
-   Markdown

### What I learned

With this challenge I've learned about CSS positioning and refresh early concepts.  

To see how you can add some code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>Find this tag helpful to keep your code tidy.</main>
```

```css
body {
display: flex; (Best layout for this challenge).
}
```

### Useful resources

-   [Bootstrap Cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/card/) - I really liked this pattern and I recommend for this case.
-   [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand positioning and CSS layout.
